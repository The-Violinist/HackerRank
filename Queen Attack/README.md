# Attack in progress
These are 2 iterations of the Queen's Attak solution. Both are a work in progress.

queens_attack.py is a valid solution to the problem but does not complete in the required amount of time.
queens_attack1.py finally does not time out. However it does not solve the 10/22 data sets correctly.
